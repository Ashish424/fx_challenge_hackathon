You will need to use your coding ability to create ‘sparks’. You are provided with some models/assets, a reference scene and a rough sketch for visual direction. You can start with the reference scene and its coding language or create your own from scratch in your language of choice. You are not allowed to use any physics/collision engines such as Bullet, unity, unreal etc. You essentially have to write code for the mathematics (external vector/math library allowed) and physics (external library not allowed as mentioned above) of the motion of the sparks.


Various Levels of Complexities:

L0: Basic natural motion of sparks (projectile motion, air and ground friction)  
L1: Collision with ground plane  
L2: Sparks should split randomly post collision to give variation  
L3: Collision with a minimum of one of the given primitive shapes  
L4: Collision with the ‘Stanford Bunny’  

You are free to use graphical enhancements (sprites/glow/complex-lighting etc.) on your output to make it visually appealing and look natural/realistic.
